Project suggested settings :
-Go to Menu -> Edit -> Project Settings -> Quality.
-Select Default Iphone Settings -> Good ( This way what you see in Editor is what you get on Device, if you develop for Android, change this too ).
-Select Antialiasing -> 4x multisampling ( All shaders included are designed for best cooperation with this mode - Try this setting for your apps).
-Select Blend Weights -> 4 Bones ( The beautiful model from Mixamo has really fluid motion under this setting - Avoid this setting for your apps).
